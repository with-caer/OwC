# **O**perations **w**ith **C**aer

Reusable tooling for development environments (_"Workbenches"_)
and production server operations.

> _Note_: OwC tooling is built primarily for Fedora and Rocky Linux hosts.

## Getting Started

There's three ways to get started with OwC tooling:

- Installing the [Workbench Tools](workbench/README.md#workbench-tools)
directly onto any UNIX-compatible system.

- Using the prebuilt [workbench dev container](workbench/README.md#with-a-dev-container), 
which includes all of the workbench tools along with some recommended default packages.

- Configuring a fresh VM or server as a [cloud workbench](workbench/README.md#with-a-vmservercomputer).

Refer to the [workbench](workbench/) documentation for more info.
